                His music is very energetic and easy going and can make you feel as if you were in a beautiful fantasy world. 
                This can be best felt when playing the original Secret of Mana series.

            <p id="quote">"Vision, it’s very important. If you want to send a clear image to someone through music, 
                you must hold on to your own images in your memory. Think about it - if you have no experiences in life, 
                you will not be able to create any images. Go, see, and experience it! It’s a simple way to enrich your life. 
                I, for example, travelled abroad to many different countries, like the UK, Hawaii, Germany, the Fiji islands, and many more."
